#Project 2

In this project we add new html and css skills. 
The page integrates flexbox tools to organize the diferent elements, tries to use precise syntax in both html and css, using
the proper tags and BEM methodology to structure the classes and different files. 
In this second part some animations and transformations are used, we apply the BEM methodology to reuse code as well as other
funtionalities such as embed elements from other websites.

Right now im currently working on more compatibilty for other browser and adding a form with styles for the potential user.
